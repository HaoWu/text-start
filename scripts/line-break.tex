\section{Spring, the Sweet Spring}

Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king; \\[1cm]
Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring, \\[1.5cm]
Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing, \\[2cm]
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!\\
--------------------------------------

\noindent
The palm and may make country houses gay, \linebreak
Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day, \linebreak
And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay: \linebreak
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!\linebreak

\noindent
The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet, \newline
Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit, \newline
In every street these tunes our ears do greet: \newline
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to witta-woo!
